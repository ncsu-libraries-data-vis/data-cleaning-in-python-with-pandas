[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NCSU-Libraries/data-viz-workshops/blob/master/Python_Open_Labs/Data_wrangling_with_Pandas/Python_Open_Labs_Week2.ipynb)

These workshop materials provide an introduction to common methods for cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis with the Python pandas data analysis library.

Topics covered with the pandas library include:

- Reading and writing data files

- Exploring dataset characteristics

- Manipulating a dataset (adding/removing/editing data)

- Filtering a dataset

This workshop uses a Jupyter notebook to incorporate editable Python code and descriptive explanations. and run the code, click the Open in Colab button above, while signed in to a Google account. With the Colab notebook open, click the "Copy to Drive" button to make a copy attached to your own Google account.
