[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ncsu-libraries-data-vis/data-cleaning-in-python-with-pandas/blob/main/Data_Cleaning_in_Python_with_pandas.ipynb)

These workshop materials provide an introduction to common methods for cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis with the Python pandas data analysis library.

Topics covered with the pandas library include:

- Reading and writing data files

- Exploring dataset characteristics

- Manipulating a dataset (adding/removing/editing data)

- Filtering a dataset

This workshop uses a Jupyter notebook to incorporate editable Python code and descriptive explanations. and run the code, click the Open in Colab button above, while signed in to a Google account.
